AWS AMI with HashiCorp
----------------------

This [fork](https://github.com/QubitPi/mieru) provides a robust, automated solution for deploying the
[mita server](server-install) onto AWS EC2 instances. Leveraging HashiCorp [Packer] and [Terraform], we streamline the
process of building a _hardened_ Amazon Machine Image ([AMI]) and then efficiently deploying it as scalable cloud
infrastructure. This approach ensures consistency, reduces manual effort, and provides a secure, reproducible method for
provisioning mieru proxy services.

!!! tip

    In the context of cloud infrastructure and AMIs, __hardening__ refers to the process of securing a system by
    reducing its attack surface and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. It involves configuring the operating system
    and installed software to be more resistant to attacks. For an AMI, hardening typically includes steps like:

    - __Removing unnecessary software and services__: Less software means fewer potential vulnerabilities.
    - __Applying security patches and updates__: Ensuring the OS and applications are up-to-date with the latest fixes.
    - __Configuring firewalls__: Restricting network access to only essential ports and protocols.
    - __Disabling unused ports and protocols__: Closing off potential entry points.
    - __Implementing strong authentication policies__: Enforcing complex passwords, multi-factor authentication, and
      secure SSH configurations.
    - __Setting secure file permissions__: Restricting access to sensitive files and directories.
    - __Logging and auditing__: Configuring the system to log relevant security events and enable auditing.

    The list doesn't end here, but the goal of creating a "hardened AMI" is to build a __secure and resilient base
    image__ that minimizes security risks from the moment an instance is launched, which is a critical step in
    maintaining a strong security posture for your cloud deployments.
